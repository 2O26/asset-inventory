    <title>Introduction</title>
    <section>
      <title>Background</title>
      <para>Projektet har i syfte om att utveckla en Asset Inventory åt Knowit Cybersecurity &amp; Law. Tanken är en modulbaserad webapplikation som är flexibel och smidig att använda för att en organisation ska snabbt kunna identifiera och kategorisera sina IT-tillgångar.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Strategic Goals</title>
      <para>Systemet ska kunna inhämta, uppdatera och presentera information om tillgångar i IT-miljön samt eventuella beroenden mellan tillgångarna.</para>
      <para>* Automatisk inhämtning och uppdatering</para>
      <para>* Beroendeanalys</para>
      <para>* Scenario Impact Simulation</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Scope</title>
      <para>Huvudsakligt fokus ligger på att utveckla själva bas-systemet med funktionalitet för att hantera tillgångar i IT-miljön och erbjuda ett användargränssnitt för detta. Då ett mål är att lätt kunna utöka funktionaliteten kommer dock några moduler för t.ex. datainhämtning att behöva utvecklas.</para>

    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Customizable</title>
      <para>To improve usability for different stakeholders and support the business as far as possible the application must be customizable in various aspects.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Always current information</title>
      <para>To improve the utility of the application the information contained must be kept updated and current.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Present relevant information</title>
      <para>Different stakeholders will be interested in different information regarding an asset, the application must be able to filter out what information is relevant for a specific stakeholder to avoid information overload.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Highly Available</title>
      <para>To avoid downtime when needed the application must be built so it can be deployed in an high availability configuration.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Enable risk based decision making</title>
      <para>To be able to take decisions based on risk, sufficient information about assets criticality is needed</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Resilient</title>
      <para>In the face of malfunction the application should recover to normal operation as fast as possible and adapt to handle similar events in the future.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Role Based Access</title>
      <para>Different users need access to different views and functionality in the application. To be able to control this role based access to the system and the information should be used.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Represent different types of assets</title>
      <para>To maximise the ability to provide relevant information about assets, the applikation must be able to represent different types of assets with different properties.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Represent dependencies between assets</title>
      <para>No asset exists in isolation, to improve the ability to analyse the components of a system the application must be able to represent different types of dependencies between assets.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Extendable</title>
      <para>To improve portability and usability the applikation should be easily extendable with modules or plug-ins, for instance to change authentication mechanism or add methods for collecting data about an asset type.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Secure</title>
      <para>Since the information contained in the system might be sensitive the system must be as secure as possible. Access-control, accounting and ensuring integrity of data is especially important.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>User Friendly</title>
      <para>The application must be user friendly and intuitive to use.</para>
      <para>Aspects of user interface and workflow must be considered.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Support Change Management</title>
      <para>To be able to securely perform changes in the operating environment it must be possible to determine what impact a change might cause on other systems.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Support Risk Management</title>
      <para>To efficiently manage risks it must be possible to determine what threats and vulnerabilities that is present in the environment and how exposed the environment is.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Integrity_Threat: Information outdated</title>
      <para>The information in the inventory does not reflect the current reality.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Integrity_Threat: Unauthorized changes to asset information</title>
      <para>Changes can be made to stored information in such way that the new information does not reflect the reality any more.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Integrity_Threat: A08 – Software and Data Integrity Failures</title>
      <para>Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations. An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise. Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations. Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Demands: Information not sufficient</title>
      <para>The information available in the inventory is not sufficient for the stakeholder to perform it's work, making it necessary to consult external sources for the information</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Availability_Threat: External sources unavailable</title>
      <para>External information sources is unavailable, for instance due to network outage.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Availability_Threat: Loss of infrastructure</title>
      <para>Full, or partial, loss of infrastructure such as network devices and storage nodes.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Confidentiality_Threat: Access to sensitive asset information</title>
      <para>The inventory will contain information that is sensitive, for instance known vulnerabilities and internal documentation.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Confidentiality_Threat: A02 – Cryptographic Failures</title>
      <para>The first thing is to determine the protection needs of data in transit and at rest. For example, passwords, credit card numbers, health records, personal information, and business secrets require extra protection, mainly if that data falls under privacy laws, e.g., EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or regulations, e.g., financial data protection such as PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Accountability_Threat: A09 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures</title>
      <para>Without logging and monitoring, breaches cannot be detected. Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and active response occurs any time:</para>
      <para>* Auditable events, such as logins, failed logins, and high-value transactions, are not logged.</para>
      <para>* Warnings and errors generate no, inadequate, or unclear log messages.</para>
      <para>* Logs of applications and APIs are not monitored for suspicious activity.</para>
      <para>* Logs are only stored locally.</para>
      <para>* Appropriate alerting thresholds and response escalation processes are not in place or effective.</para>
      <para>* Penetration testing and scans by dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools (such as OWASP ZAP) do not trigger alerts.</para>
      <para>* The application cannot detect, escalate, or alert for active attacks in real-time or near real-time.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A01 – Broken Access Control</title>
      <para>Access control enforces policy such that users cannot act outside of their intended permissions. </para>
      <para>Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A07 – Identification and Authentication Failures</title>
      <para>Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management is critical to protect against authentication-related attacks.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A03 – Injection</title>
      <para>Some of the more common injections are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL) injection. The concept is identical among all interpreters.</para>
      <para>An application is vulnerable to attack when:</para>
      <para>* User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application.</para>
      <para>* Dynamic queries or non-parameterized calls without context-aware escaping are used directly in the interpreter.</para>
      <para>* Hostile data is used within object-relational mapping (ORM) search parameters to extract additional, sensitive records.</para>
      <para>* Hostile data is directly used or concatenated. The SQL or command contains the structure and malicious data in dynamic queries, commands, or stored procedures.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A04 – Insecure Design</title>
      <para>Insecure design is a broad category representing different weaknesses, expressed as “missing or ineffective control design.” There is a difference between insecure design and insecure implementation; we differentiate between design flaws and implementation defects for a reason, they have different root causes and remediation. A secure design can still have implementation defects leading to vulnerabilities that may be exploited. An insecure design cannot be fixed by a perfect implementation as by definition, needed security controls were never created to defend against specific attacks.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A05 – Security Misconfiguration</title>
      <para>The application might be vulnerable if the application is:</para>
      <para>* Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.</para>
      <para>* Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).</para>
      <para>* Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.</para>
      <para>* Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.</para>
      <para>* For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.</para>
      <para>* The security settings in the application servers, application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.</para>
      <para>* The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.</para>
      <para>* The software is out of date or vulnerable</para>
      <para>Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration process, systems are at a higher risk</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A06 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components</title>
      <para>You are likely vulnerable:</para>
      <para>* If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly use as well as nested dependencies.</para>
      <para>* If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly happens in environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task under change control, leaving organizations open to days or months of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.</para>
      <para>* If you do not secure the components’ configurations (see A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title>Threat: A10 - Server-Side Request Forgery</title>
      <para>SSRF flaws occur whenever a web application is fetching a remote resource without validating the user-supplied URL. It allows an attacker to coerce the application to send a crafted request to an unexpected destination, even when protected by a firewall, VPN, or another type of network access control list (ACL).</para>
      <para>As modern web applications provide end-users with convenient features, fetching a URL becomes a common scenario. As a result, the incidence of SSRF is increasing. Also, the severity of SSRF is becoming higher due to cloud services and the complexity of architectures.</para>
